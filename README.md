# Cleaned-NYUv2

The NYU-Depth V2 dataset is comprised of video sequences from a variety of indoor scenes as recorded by both the RGB and Depth cameras from the Microsoft Kinect. The dataset has 1449 RGB-D images of indoor scenes and one description per image. We propose a cleaned version of the dataset captions due to inconsistent descriptions in the dataset.
